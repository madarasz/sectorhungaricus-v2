      ### Custom miniatures

      We love conversions and 3D printed alternative models, so go wild! It doesn't even matter if the species are different. The important things are:

      - Base size is super important in Kill Team. Always check the datacards to see which size to use.

      - Opponents should be able to tell which operative is which. (i.e., Comms guy having a radio helps to identify him)

      - The weapons on the figure don't have to match your current loadout (WYSIWYG not needed). Just tell your opponent about your choices before the match.

      - The conversion's size and silhouette should be similar to the original model. (i.e., don't use a small grot for a space marine with a huge banner)

      - Before tournaments, always ask for the approval of the organizer. (You should be fine if overall size and base size match)

      ### Markers and tokens

      The *Hivestorm* box contains the latest, third edition, generic tokens. New team boxes contain team-specific tokens. As long as your opponent understands what they mean, you can use any similar solution:

      - Official tokens from the previous, second edition

      - Coins, cardboard, or cardboard glued to coins

      - 3D printed order tokens

      - Fancy, expensive, laser-cut/wooden/minted tokens from Etsy

      ### Terrain

      Friendly local game stores (FLGS) and clubs have terrain that you can use. You probably have to pay a small fee, but this is your easiest and cheapest option.


      Official terrain is expensive (~30k Ft), but very nice and detailed. The community also makes map packs for these sets, so you will have "balanced and fair" layouts. The most popular ones are:


      - **Volkus** (in *Hivestorm* box) is the newest hotness

      - **Octarius**

      - **Gallowdark** (often referred to as "Into the Dark" or "ItD") - This terrain uses additional "condensed environments" rules. There were several big boxes including it with two teams. You can also get it by buying half a box of *WH40k Boarding Actions* terrain.

      - **Tomb World** - It will be released soon, we don't know the details yet, but it's going to be hot!


      MDF or cardboard terrain is also a good option for half the price (10-15k Ft) though less detailed. Check out TTCombat or Battle Systems. TTCombat's Raised District is very similar to Volkus and Orc Mega Bunker mimics Octarius.


      You can also make your own terrain with small boxes, cardboard, toy buildings, soda cans, etc. Kill Team uses much more terrain than larger-scale wargames. Detailed nooks on elements provide additional cover options. Recommended setup includes:

      - 2-4 large buildings or ruins

      - 2-4 smaller terrain pieces (e.g., crumbling walls, pipes, containers)

      - Scattered minor elements (e.g., barricades, barrels, crates)


      3D printing terrain is possible, but unless you own the printer, it will likely be as expensive as buying an official set.

      ### Datacards, mission and equipment cards, rulebook

      There are official, printed Games Workshop products available for purchase. The issue is that with quarterly balance updates, these rules and cards will have outdated information. Check the **Resources** section to find up-to-date cards to print and websites with the latest rules.
