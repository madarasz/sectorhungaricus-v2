      #### Size


      The primary brush sizes you will need are **0**, **1**, and **2**. While smaller sizes exist (such as **00** and **000**), we generally don't recommend them. Precise detail work requires a sharp tip, not necessarily a smaller brush. Tiny brushes hold very little paint, causing it to dry on the bristles before you even touch the model.


      For "surgical" tasks—like painting eyes or script on a purity seal—you might actually find more success using a toothpick or an ultra-fine pigment liner pen.


      #### Material


      **Synthetic brushes**: Cheap and perfect for beginners.  Be warned that the plastic fibers tend to lose their shape over time, so you have to replace them after a while. We recommend the **Munkácsy** brand, it's affordable and has good quality.


      **Kolinsky Sable**: Considered the gold standard of the hobby, these brushes are made from natural hair that possesses a unique "snap," allowing the bristles to spring back to a perfect point every time. They feature a larger belly that holds more paint and moisture. With some care, you will be using them for a long time.

      metallic paints. They permanently damage the brush, switch to synthetic
      instead."
