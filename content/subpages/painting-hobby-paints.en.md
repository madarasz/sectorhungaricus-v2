      ### Which paints should I buy?


      Stick with **ACRYLIC** paints. They are easy to work with, mix with water, and perfect for this hobby. Here are some solid brands to look for:

      - **Vallejo Game Color** *(Vallejo Model Color is also fine)*

      - **AK 3rd Gen**

      - **Army Painter Warpaints Fanatic** *(Make sure it says "Fanatic" on the label, that is the newer, better version. The older version had issues.)*

      ### What to avoid?

      - **Cheap, generic art supply paints**: Don't go for this to save a buck. They will cause all sorts of problems and make painting less fun.

      - **Citadel**: They are pricey and the bottle design is horrible. They spill easily, dry out and are though to mix. The quality is usually good, but some colors are just bad. Only grab these if you want a specific color. (Their *Contrast* paints are awesome, just transfer them to a dropper bottle.)

      ### Types of paints


      - **Primer**: It creates a durable, chemically receptive surface that ensures subsequent coats of paint bond firmly to the plastic, resin, or metal. Always prime your miniature before applying other paints. Black primer is usually the best choice.

      - **Base/Layer**: "Regular" paints that provide the primary colors of your miniature.

      - **Wash/Shade**: Designed with a thin, watery consistency, these flow naturally into the recesses of a model to create instant shadows and define fine details.

      - **One-Coat**: These specialized, high-transparency paints (like *Vallejo Xpress*, *Citadel Contrast* or *Army Painter Speedpaint*) provide base coloring and shading in a single application. Use them over a light base color.
