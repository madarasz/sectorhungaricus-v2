      ### Recommended Games Workshop products

      - [Starter set (2024)](https://start-warhammer.com/kill-team/) - Includes all the essentials: two teams, dice, measuring tools, tokens, game board and MDF terrain (no vantage or light terrain). This is the most cost-effective option for two players entering the hobby. The two teams (*Angels of Death*, *Plague Marines*) are also ideal for newcomers.

      - [Hivestorm (2024)](https://start-warhammer.com/kill-team-hivestorm/) - A comprehensive package containing everything needed to play. In addition to the Starter Set contents, it includes plastic terrain (*Volkus*), rulebook, mission book, equipment models, mission and equipment cards. Note that the included teams (*Tempestus Aquilons*, *Vespids*) may present more complexity for beginners.

      - [Tomb World (2025)](https://www.warhammer.com/en-EU/shop/kill-team-tomb-world-eng-2025) is the newest expansion, containing two new kill teams and a veritable mountain of terrain. The Deathwatch are the OG kill team, a collection of veterans drawn from disparate Space Marine Chapters who band together to combine their unique skills into an elite but specialised unit. The box contains enough miniatures to make two teams of five, or 10 of the possible 11 operatives. They are pitted against the Canoptek Circle – a cohort of insectile Necron constructs conducted in combat by a Geomancer, who enhances the technological tricks of their followers.
