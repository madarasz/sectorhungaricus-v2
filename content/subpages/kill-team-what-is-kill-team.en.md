      ### General Overview

      - Kill Team is a deep and complex strategy game that rewards tactical planning, clever use of terrain, and outsmarting your opponent. Every decision you make shapes the battle's outcome.

      - While dice rolls decide combat results, player skill remains the key to victory. Success hinges on smart risk management, prioritizing objectives, and adapting your strategy to the shifting game state.

      - Games typically last 1.5 to 2.5 hours, with duration depending on your experience with the game and your knowledge of your team's rules and abilities.

      - You take turns activating individual operatives, keeping downtime short and the action flowing.

      - Your kill team comprises 5-14 specialist operatives, led by a leader unit. Each operative brings unique abilities and roles, while your faction offers distinct tactical edges through special abilities (ploys) and equipment options.

      - Pre-game choices are critical - you'll assemble your team from a faction roster, choosing operatives, weapon loadouts, and equipment based on your opponent's faction, mission objectives, and battlefield terrain.

      - Victory demands balancing multiple goals: securing strategic locations, completing your secret mission, and eliminating enemy operativesâ€”all while thwarting your opponent's plans.

      - The game stays fresh through regular updates: new factions are introduced periodically, and quarterly balance adjustments ensure competitive fairness across all teams.
