# Kill Team

Kill Team is Games Workshop's skirmish-scale miniature wargame set in the grim darkness of Warhammer 40,000's far future. Command a small squad of elite operatives as they engage in fast-paced, tactical combat across war-torn battlefields.

## What is Kill Team?

Unlike the massive armies of Warhammer 40,000, Kill Team focuses on small squads of highly specialized operatives. Each model is an individual fighter with their own weapons, equipment, and tactical roles.

## Getting Started

- **Team Size**: 6-10 models per team
- **Game Time**: 60-90 minutes
- **Space Required**: 4x3 feet battlefield
- **Difficulty**: Beginner friendly
